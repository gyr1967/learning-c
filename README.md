Following 'The C Programming Language' by Kernighan and Ritchie in an effort to make 3rd year of uni less stressful. 2nd hand copy of the text happens to be signed by the authors, pretty cool.
Will be writing code in the CLion environment using C99 as the standard.
The file structure and contents may be messy, I didn't have it all planned out starting off and didn't know the limitations on main() occurring multiple times.
